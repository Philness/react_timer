REGEX
    Use str.match(regex) to make sure that a string consists only of the characters you want.
    regex starts and ends with //, with a [] set, saying the string has to match what's inside.
    By default it only matches one character, end it with a star to make it match more than one.
    The ^ character says that the starting character also must match.
    The $ character says that the ending character also must match.

PARSEINT
    Use parseint(string, base) to change a string into a number.
    If no base is specified, the number will be parsed to base 10.
    Any number starting with 0x will be parsed to base 16.
    Make sure to use regex beforehand to make sure that what you're passing is parse-worthy.
